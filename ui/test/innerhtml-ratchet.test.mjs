/* Raw `el.innerHTML = ` and `el.insertAdjacentHTML(...)` string-building is
   safe only while every interpolation remembers esc(). setHtml() + html`` from
   utils.js remove that requirement.

   Two directories are scanned. ui/js is fully migrated, so its budget is empty
   and any write there fails.

   ui/widgets was outside the scan entirely (P8-1, P14-3): 3,660 lines where an
   upstream value could be interpolated into markup with nothing to catch it.
   The four sites that actually took upstream data were fixed in Wave 1
   (P14-1); the 16 below are static strings and computed numbers, so they are
   safe as written and are recorded as a budget rather than migrated. What the
   budget buys is the next write, not these. widget-toolbox.js re-exports esc,
   html and setHtml, so a widget has the safe path available.

   Lower a number when you migrate one. Never raise one.

   Two things are deliberately not counted:

   Reads (`if (el.innerHTML)`) do not write markup.

   Clears (`el.innerHTML = ''`) interpolate nothing, so there is no value to
   escape and no way for them to be unsafe. */
