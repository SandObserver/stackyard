/* Regression tests for P9-8: page dots were not controls.

   When a dashboard holds more apps than fit on one screen, the dots at the
   bottom move between pages. They were plain divs with a click handler, and a
   div is not a control: Tab skips it, a screen reader announces nothing, and
   Enter and Space do nothing. Paging worked by pointer only, so a keyboard user
   could not leave page one.

   They are real buttons now. Reaching for role="button" and tabindex instead
   would mean reimplementing by hand what the element already does, and the key
   handling is the part that gets forgotten.

   Built in JavaScript against a live document, so these read the source. The
   behaviour they pin is the shape of what is built rather than what a browser
   does with it, which is the browser's job once it is a button. */
