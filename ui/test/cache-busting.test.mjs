/* Regression tests for P17-9: an unstamped asset reference stayed unstamped.

   Browsers cache JavaScript and CSS, so each reference carries a ?v= stamp that
   changes with the file's contents. The script that maintains those stamps only
   matched references that already had one, so a reference written without one
   was invisible to it and never became cache-busted. A browser then kept serving
   that file from cache after an upgrade while every other file was refreshed,
   leaving a page running mixed versions, which is an awkward thing to diagnose.

   One reference was in that state: spotlight.js imported utils.js unstamped.

   Fixing the reference alone would leave the tool unable to see the problem it
   exists to prevent, so the pattern accepts a missing stamp and `--check` fails
   on one. This test is the same rule, so a failure is visible from the test suite
   rather than only from the build. */
