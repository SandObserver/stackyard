/* Every catalog key is referenced by name, and every name referenced exists.

   P15-1 and P15-4. This could not be checked before, because the app
   translated two different ways. Most strings were looked up by key, but about
   50 were translated by matching their rendered English text against the
   catalog at runtime: the markup said "Name" and a reverse map swapped it for
   "Nom". Reachability was then a substring search over the source, which can
   only ever be a guess, and the mechanism failed in ways nothing reported:
   editing the English text in markup silently stopped that string translating,
   in every language; three keys shared the text "Search", so whichever was
   read last won; and short values like "All" or "Set" were swapped wherever
   they appeared.

   Those sites now name their key, the reverse map is gone, and the question is
   exactly decidable. Both directions are checked, and both start clean.

   A key referenced through a variable, as password-strength.js does with its
   labelKey, is still found: the key appears as a string literal in the source
   even though it is not written inside the t() call. That is the one thing
   this cannot follow, so a key assembled from pieces at runtime would need an
   entry in DYNAMIC below. Nothing needs one today. */
