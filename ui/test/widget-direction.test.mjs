/* Widgets follow the interface direction, which is what makes a Persian
   dashboard mirror properly. The System Summary is the deliberate exception.

   Its content is percentages, byte counts and sparklines rather than prose.
   Mirroring moved the value column to the right and ran each sparkline's time
   axis from right to left, which reads as a rendering fault rather than as a
   translation, and Apple's guidance keeps content with its own inherent
   directionality unmirrored.

   The exception lives on the widget's own root, so the document still carries
   the page's language and direction for anything that reads them, including the
   screen-reader summary, which is prose and does follow the page.

   Pinned here because `dir="ltr"` on one element looks exactly like an
   oversight: without a test, the next person to tidy the markup removes it and
   the layout silently starts mirroring again. */
