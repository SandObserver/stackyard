/* A refused widget has to explain itself where it is missing from.

   The reasons already travelled with /api/widgets and were rendered in exactly
   one place: the config editor of a dashboard item already using that widget.
   That is the one case a refused widget cannot produce for a new install, so a
   widget whose manifest was refused simply never appeared in the type list and
   the reason stayed in the container log.

   The wording and filtering are pure and tested in admin-logic.test.mjs. These
   are the wiring: both places go through that one helper, and the picker path
   renders it. Asserted as source text because the form builds DOM and there is
   no browser here. */
