/* WCAG contrast for the admin greys, computed rather than recorded.

   Secondary text sat at 3.48 against a card and 4.27 against the pane, where
   1.4.3 asks 4.5; borders sat at 1.90 and 2.33 against the 3.0 of 1.4.11. The
   numbers had been measured by hand and written into a comment, which is how
   they went stale: the palette moved to Apple's system greys underneath them
   and nothing recomputed anything.

   So the ratios are computed here from the files themselves. A colour change
   that drops a pair below its threshold fails, and no one has to remember to
   re-measure.

   Only the pairs that carry a requirement are listed. A decorative separator is
   not a UI component under 1.4.11, and asserting a threshold on one would mean
   raising it for no reason a user could name. */
