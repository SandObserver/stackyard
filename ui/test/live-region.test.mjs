/* Regression tests for P9-9: a page change was never announced.

   A screen reader reads a live region when its contents change, which is how a
   user hears the result of something they just did. The dashboard had one for
   search results and nothing else, so paging swapped the grid in silence.

   That mattered more after the page dots became real buttons: a control that
   can be reached and operated, whose effect is never announced, is arguably
   worse than one that cannot be reached at all.

   Deliberately not extended to health changes. Those are polled rather than
   user-initiated, so announcing them would have a screen reader talk over
   whatever someone is doing whenever a service flaps; the reason a tile is red
   is in its hover text instead. A live region should say what the user did, not
   everything that changes. */
