/* P7-3 and P7-4: tests left temporary files behind, and some wrote to shared
   paths.

   Two shapes, one cause — nothing owned the cleanup.

   A test that called fs.mkdtempSync directly usually never removed the result.
   Measured before this landed: one run left 49 directories behind, and 2,354
   had accumulated over three days, about 205 MB.

   A test that pointed CONFIG_PATH at a fixed path such as
   /tmp/stackyard-auth-test-nonexistent.json was relying on nothing ever
   creating it. That held until a test called something that writes config, at
   which point the file survived the run and every later run read what the last
   one stored. It happened during this work: a stale secret kept reappearing
   and the failure looked like a bug in the code under test.

   test-support/tmp.js is the one way to get a temporary path, and registers
   removal. These tests keep it the only way. */
