   fixed path it expects never to exist and both of these create it. A test that
   writes to a shared fixed path leaves the next run reading whatever the last
   one stored.

   P2-7, P2-9, P2-10: the two were the same function apart from one
   short-circuit, and the random value they produce was written inline at four
   call sites, so the strength and encoding of the key that signs every session
   was defined in four places. */
