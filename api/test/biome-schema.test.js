/* P17-4: biome.json pinned a schema version that nothing kept in step.

   It said 2.5.3 while package.json pinned 2.5.6, and every lint run printed a
   "configuration schema version does not match the CLI version" notice.
   Dependabot bumps package.json weekly and never touches biome.json, so the
   gap reopened on its own after every upgrade and could only be closed by
   remembering to edit a second file by hand.

   The fix is to stop naming a version. Biome ships configuration_schema.json
   inside the package, so pointing at that path means the schema is always
   whatever is installed. There is no number to drift.

   These tests keep it that way: a versioned URL is how the problem comes back. */
