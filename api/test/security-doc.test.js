/* docs/security.md against the code it describes.

   Three claims on that page had gone stale: it warned about `X-Forwarded-For`,
   which nothing reads any more; it explained the client-address guarantee by
   nginx overwriting the header rather than by the loopback check that actually
   enforces it; and it credited the Compose file with running the API as a
   non-root user, which the image does.

   A security page that is wrong is worse than one that is missing, because it
   is what someone reads before deciding how to expose this. The claims that can
   be checked against the code are checked here, so the same drift fails a test
   rather than sitting on the page.

   The blocked-address table is pinned separately, in blocked-ranges.test.js.

   Prose is deliberately matched loosely, by the value or symbol it names, not
   by sentence. A test that pins wording turns every edit into a test edit and
   gets weakened until it means nothing. */
