/* P5-3, P5-4, P18-2: ctx.settings was loadConfig().settings itself.

   Every widget data function received the session signing key and the password
   hash under settings.auth, the host IP, port map, TLS-skip flag and Docker
   socket URL under settings.server, and held the live cached object, so it
   could rewrite any of them for the rest of the config cache's lifetime. One
   key in the repository is read this way: stats.diskMount.

   The list is an allowlist so that a secret added under settings later is
   withheld by default rather than shared until someone remembers to deny it. */
