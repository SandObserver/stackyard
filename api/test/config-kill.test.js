/* The config write, interrupted for real.

   config-durability.test.js pins the calls that make a write survive a power
   cut: temp file, fsync, rename, fsync the directory. It cannot show that the
   sequence works, because it never stops the process partway through.

   This does. A child process saves a large config in a loop; the parent kills
   it with SIGKILL, which cannot be caught, deferred or cleaned up after, at a
   randomised moment; the parent then reads what is on disk. The rule the write
   exists to guarantee is that a reader never sees a partial config: whatever
   survives must parse, and must be a config, every time.

   SIGKILL mid-write is the closest a test gets to the case this protects
   against, which is a Pi on an SD card being unplugged. It is not the same
   thing: the kernel still has the page cache, so this proves atomicity of the
   rename rather than durability of the bytes. Durability is what fsync buys and
   nothing in a test can observe it.

   Deliberately slower than the rest of the suite. It runs a handful of
   iterations rather than dozens, and the delays are spread across the range
   where a write is likely to be in flight.

   Whether a given kill lands inside a write or between two of them is not
   controllable, and measuring it beforehand put it at roughly one iteration in
   five. A leftover .tmp is the evidence that one did, so each iteration reports
   whether it interrupted a write. That count is not asserted on: an assertion
   that depends on timing would be retried until it passed, which is worse than
   not having it. The assertion that does hold on every iteration, interrupted
   or not, is that the config on disk is complete. */
