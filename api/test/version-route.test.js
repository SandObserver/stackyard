/* Regression test for P6-11: a failed version check kept hitting GitHub.

   The cache guard was `latest !== null`, so a lookup that failed left it null and
   the next request went straight back to GitHub. Unauthenticated callers get 60
   requests an hour, so an install that cannot reach GitHub, or one behind blocked
   egress, spent that quota and stayed rate-limited. The comment said the
   timestamp was kept to hold the result, and it was; it just was not consulted.

   The decision is tested as a pure function rather than by counting calls
   through a stub. version.js captures fetchUnchecked when it loads, so replacing
   the export afterwards has no effect, and adding an injection point to
   production code purely so a test can reach it is worse than testing the rule
   directly. */
