/* Regression tests for P3-3: a ping could run past its time budget.

   Node's socket-level `timeout` is an inactivity timer on the socket and does
   not reliably bound a stalled DNS lookup, TCP connect or TLS handshake.
   fetchJSON carried a second timer covering the whole attempt; pingUrl did not,
   so against a host that accepts the connection then goes silent it took twice
   its budget: 4 seconds for a 2 second limit.

   That matters most for health checks, where a service that is reachable but
   hung is exactly the case being tested for, and the pings run in parallel, so
   the overshoot held up the whole health response rather than one tile.

   The deadline is one helper used by both, since two copies of a timing rule is
   how the two came to differ. */
