/* P3-5: "is this host internal" existed twice and the copies disagreed.

   guardSsrf excluded IPv6 literals from the dotless Docker-service-name
   allowance, because a literal is dotless too and is separated only by its
   colons. shouldSkipTls was a bare `!hostname.includes('.')`, so it never got
   that exclusion, and it never stripped the brackets URL leaves on an IPv6
   hostname either. Two consequences, both only reachable with skipTlsVerify on:

     a public IPv6 address such as [2001:4860:4860::8888] counted as a Docker
     service name and had its certificate left unverified

     a private IPv6 address such as [fd00::1] could not match the private-range
     check at all, because isPrivateAddress does not recognise the bracketed
     form, and passed only by the same dotless accident

   The classification is now one definition. The verdict still is not shared:
   guardSsrf lets a service name through and blocks loopback, while the TLS-skip
   check treats both as internal. */
