/* Regression test for P6-2: an item with two health checks lost one's detail.

   /api/health answers with `unhealthy` plus whatever explains it: `state` and
   `status` from Docker, `pingStatus` and `pingError` from the URL check. For an
   item configured with both, the ping's result replaced the container's entry
   rather than joining it, so the container detail was discarded.

   `unhealthy` was correct either way, being carried in a local across both
   checks, so nothing looked broken. What was lost is the reason behind a red
   tile, which is now its hover text; see healthReason in ui/js/badge-logic.js. */
