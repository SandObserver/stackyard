/* Regression tests for P13-2: a missing service address became http://undefined.

   The Connections widget had two nearly identical URL normalisers. The VPN path
   used one that returned '' for a missing address and reported "No control
   server URL configured". The map path used its own copy without that guard, so
   a service with no address fetched http://undefined: a real DNS lookup for a
   host called "undefined", failing after a timeout with "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND
   undefined".

   The widget therefore looked like it had a network fault when a field was
   simply empty, and the error pointed at DNS rather than at the empty field.

   Two copies of one rule is how they came to disagree, so there is one now. */
