/* The only way a test should get a temporary directory.

   P7-3 and P7-4. Two problems, one cause: nothing owned the cleanup.

   Tests that called fs.mkdtempSync directly mostly never removed the result.
   Measured before this landed: one run of the suite left 49 directories behind,
   and 2,354 had accumulated over three days, about 205 MB.

   Tests that instead pointed CONFIG_PATH at a fixed path like
   /tmp/stackyard-auth-test-nonexistent.json were relying on nothing ever
   creating it. That held until a test called something that writes config, at
   which point the file persisted and every later run read what the previous one
   had stored. That is not hypothetical; it happened during this work and cost
   an afternoon, because a stale 16-byte secret kept reappearing.

   tmpDir() gives a fresh directory and registers its removal. Removal is on
   process exit rather than in an after() hook, because most of these tests need
   their path at module scope: they set process.env.CONFIG_PATH before requiring
   the module that reads it, which happens long before any hook could run.

   ui/test/tmp-hygiene.test.mjs holds the rule, so a new test cannot go back to
   calling mkdtempSync or naming a fixed path. */
