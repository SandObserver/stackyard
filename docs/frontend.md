# Frontend

Static files, no build step. Plain ES modules loaded with `?v=` cache tags. Two independent pages, sharing no state:

- **Dashboard**: `ui/index.html`, `ui/js/dashboard.js`
- **Admin**: `ui/admin/index.html`, `ui/js/admin.js`

The admin writes the whole config with `POST /api/config`; the dashboard reads it on load, polls it, and reloads on change.

## Browser support

Safari and iOS Safari 15.4 and newer, and current Chrome, Edge and Firefox.

There is no build step and no autoprefixer, so every vendor prefix is written by hand. The support floor, the list of prefixes that are still needed and the reason each one stays are at the top of `ui/css/tokens.css`; `ui/test/vendor-prefix-ratchet.test.mjs` fails on any prefix outside that list. Note that "an unprefixed property sits beside it" is not a reason to remove one: `-webkit-backdrop-filter` is paired everywhere and still required.

## Colour

`ui/css/tokens.css` holds two layers. A palette names Apple's system colours by hue (`--sy-teal`, `--sy-red`), each with a `-hi` partner carrying Apple's increased-contrast value; the `prefers-contrast: more` block swaps the whole palette to the `-hi` set. On top, roles name what a colour is for (`--accent`, `--danger`, `--success`) and point at a hue, so changing the accent is one line.

Only dark values are defined: there is no light mode anywhere in the app.

Rules should name a role. A colour written as a literal outside `tokens.css` fails `ui/test/css-tokens.test.mjs`, which also checks that every `var()` names a token that exists. Page-specific surfaces and greys are not part of the system palette and live in that page's own `:root`.

## Widgets are iframes

Every widget tile is a sandboxed `<iframe>` whose URL comes from `WIDGET_TYPES` in `widget-types.js`. The dashboard passes only URL, size, and title; the widget fetches its own data from `/api/widget-data/<id>` and is rendered at a fixed design size scaled to the tile. So widgets are isolated and drop-in: a new one is a folder plus one registry entry, with no dashboard changes.
See [widgets.md](./widgets.md).

## Badges

`dashboard.js` polls `/api/badges` and `/api/health` and paints tiles through an id-to-elements registry. Appearance is one pure function, `computeBadgeVisual` in `badge-logic.js`.

Each of these is a single batch request: the server fetches every configured badge (or health target) concurrently, each bounded by `PING_MS`, and returns one combined object only after all of them settle. So a slow or unreachable upstream holds back the whole batch until it times out, delaying the refresh of the other tiles by up to `PING_MS`. This is bounded and fine at homelab scale; if a dashboard ever grows large enough that one dead upstream's delay is a problem, the batch would need to stream per-tile results instead.

## Cache busting

`?v=` on `/css/` and `/js/` URLs is a content hash rewritten at release by `scripts/bump-cache-busting.js`; do not edit it. `?v=` on `/widgets/` URLs in `widget-types.js` is manual: bump it when you change a widget's own files.
